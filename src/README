MAMMOTH 0.0.2 - Readme Documentation
Hello, thank you very much for your interest in the Mammoth Operating System, by Rohedin Media.
For full documentation on the uses of this program, please visit our Launchpad site:

COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS
Compilation of this program was tested on Linux Mint 5.0 (based off Ubuntu 8.10), but should
work on any Linux installation with the following programs installed:

gcc (tested with version 4.3.2)
nasm (tested with version 2.03.01)
ld (tested with version 2.18.93.20081009)
cat (tested with version 6.10)

COMPILING:
Mammoth OS comes with it's own automatic compilation script, so it should be easy enough for
anybody to compile. The script compiles the C and ASM (to make the .o files), links them
together to form a binary file, then creates a floppy image with GRUB and Mammoth OS.
To do this, type this in a terminal whilst in the mammoth directory:
./build.sh

If you get an error about permissions, run this first:
chmod 777 ./build.sh

After that it should work perfectly. The floppy image is called "floppy.img" and is saved
in the 'build' directory.

BOOTING MAMMOTH:
You can then use the floppy image created to boot mammoth. You can either extract it onto
a real floppy disc or CD, or use the image with a Virtual PC emulator, such as VirtualBox
or qemu.

When you boot the disc, you'll be brought to a GRUB boot screen. Before you can use Mammoth
you must run the following commands to boot it:

kernel 200+25
boot

Mammoth will then start.

Thanks for your interest,
The Mammoth Team.
